# qb-windowwashingjob
### How It Works Now:

1. Player starts the job at one of the building locations
2. They receive a notification to talk to the job coordinator for a vehicle
3. The job coordinator (a construction worker ped) spawns a work vehicle
4. Player can drive to each window location
5. Player must exit the vehicle before washing windows
6. Player can quit the job at any time using the UI button or `/quitjob` command
7. When the job is completed or quit, the work vehicle is automatically deleted
